* Sudoku
Sudoku is a Sudoku solution finder.  Currently it outputs only the
first solution found.

** Compiling & Installation
Just run =make= and =make install=; then you can find =sudoku= in the
=bin= directory, which is all you need to run the program.

** Running
When there are no arguments specified, the program will read from
standard input and display on standard output.  Using =-i filename=
causes the program to read the the file named =filename= as input, and
=-o filename= does the similar with the output.

The input should be a 9-by-9 matrix, where the empty places should be
represented by 0.  The program will generate the result also as a
matrix, in which all the 0 shall be substituted.
